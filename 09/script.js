 * Coding Challenge #1
Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners 
about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For 
now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy.
A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years 
old.
Your tasks:
Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages 
('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have 
cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat 
ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function 
parameters)
2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 
is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy 
ÔøΩ
")
4. Run the function for both test datasets
Test data:
¬ß Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
¬ß Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
Hints: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far ÔøΩ
GOOD LUCK ÔøΩ

   * Coding Challenge #2
  Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert 
  dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
  Your tasks:
  Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's 
  ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
  1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is 
  <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, 
  humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
  2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as 
  keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
  3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know 
  from other challenges how we calculate averages ÔøΩ)
  4. Run the function for both test datasets
  Test data:
  ¬ß Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
  ¬ß Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

/**Coding Challenge #5

Julia and Kate are still studying dogs. This time they are trying to figure out if the dogs in their area are eating too much or too little food.

Formula for calculating recommended food portion:
recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28.
(The result is in grams of food, and the weight needs to be in kg.)

Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.

Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion.

Your Tasks:

Loop over the array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate the recommended food portion (recFood) and add it to the object as a new property. Do NOT create a new array; simply loop over the array (we never did this before, so think about how you can do this without creating a new array).
