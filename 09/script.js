const team = ['John', 'Mary', ['Bob', 'Alice'], 'Tom', 'Lisa'];

/* 
Using destructuring:
1. Get only the first team member
2. Skip the second team member
3. Get both members from the nested array
4. Skip Tom and get Lisa
*/

// Write your solution belowconst numbers = [10, 20, 30];

// Using destructuring, create three variables named 'first', 'second', and 'third' 
// that contain the values from this array

const [first, second, third] = numbers;
